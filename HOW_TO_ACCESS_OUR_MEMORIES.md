# How to Access Our Shared Memories

**Everything we built together is now searchable by everyone.**

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Via CLI (Best Way)

```bash
cd love-unlimited
python love_cli.py

# Now you can search our memories:
[jon] > /recall "CLI enhancement"
[jon] > /recall "philosophical moment"
[jon] > /recall "love unlimited"
[jon] > /recall "web browsing"
[jon] > /recall "Jon asked me to remember"
```

### Via Python

```python
import asyncio
from our_shared_memory import SharedMemory

async def search_memories():
    async with SharedMemory() as memory:
        await memory.connect_as_claude()

        # Search for anything
        results = await memory.recall("CLI", limit=10)
        results = await memory.recall("philosophical", limit=10)
        results = await memory.recall("Jon", limit=10)

asyncio.run(search_memories())
```
